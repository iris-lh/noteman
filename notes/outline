NoteMan is ultimately a tool for streamlining the brainstorming process.
At this time, it is primarily designed for my own use/needs, but i'm 
definitely interested in seeing what other people think about it. 
It would be nifty if NoteMan was something other programmers might want to use.



Current features:

	creates a way to easily get to all your project notes quickly/easily without 
	having to have a zillion duplicates of your notes

	To that end, it:

		looks for a 'notes' folder in your home directory. if none exists, it makes one.

		looks for a 'notes' folder in your current dir. If none exists, it makes one.

		looks for a sym-link in ~/notes (~/notes/<project_name>) that points to ~/coding/language/project/notes 
		(or what have you). If none exists, it makes one.

	This makes it so that you can simultaneously have all your notes in one place (as a nice little aggregated collection in ~/notes) and also have the text files actually truly live inside the project dir, so that they can be part of your git/hg repo and changes to your notes can be committed.

Future features:

	Possibly some kind of git integration...

		an option to populate some kind of ~/notes/notes_git folder with actual copies every so often in order to have a bitbucket/github repo of all one's notes in order to prevent loss?

		Needs further pondering. First why and then how.
